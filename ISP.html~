    <h1>Computer Science I Individual Study Project</h1>
    <a href="cs1.html"><p>Go Back</p></a>
    <p>My CS1 ISP was a collaborative project with fellow student, Hannah Bartlett. We created a stock simulator in the format of a text adventure game. It was our first time really applying the knowledge we had learned over the year, and I learned a LOT about the creative process. How to make the things you want, how to find loopholes in errors to get the things you want, and how to when told to just scrap certain ideas because they weren't feesible with your current setup, to instead rewrite all the code you had up to that point in order to get the things you want.<br><br>Our initial concept was fairly straightforward; a stock simulator. We were both familiar and had experience in the stock market, as well as advanced stock simulations, and we wanted to try to do it ourselves. We were motivated by the fact that we just really wanted to apply all that we had learned that year, it was our first time doing a project in that class where we could totally take control, it really felt like the accumulation of a year's work. We ended up doing a majority of what we wanted to do, there was a few things we ended up having to cut just due to time constraints, but it was a super polished and bug free game by the end of it! It was genuinely so much fun, didn't regret it.<br><br>Below are a few screenshots from our code showing a few of my favorite parts!</p>

    <p>The image above shows the main exchange menu initialization that would occur every time the player jumped forward in time, it just gets the new stock prices and would apply them to the global variable.</p>

    <p>The image above I included just to how off that though it was a stock simulator, we included choose your own adventure elements! It was mainly just some minimal story, but we still had fun with including it!</p>
