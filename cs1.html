  <a href="classdirectory.html"><p>Go Back</p></a>
  <p>I took Computer Science I in my Sophomore year of Allen High School (2021-2022).<br><br>That year was a crazy time! Though I had my struggles, this course was overall a lot of fun. I met some of my closest friends, and really started branching out in what I was interested in learning how to do.<br><br>In CS1, we learned the history of computers and the progression that was made to get us where we are today. We were introduced (and may I say got more than the hang of) bash and emacs, and became experienced in Swift.</p>
