    <h1>unIQue</h1>
    <p>Our team, unIQue, consists of six diverse individuals that are knowledgeable on mental health awareness. The project consists of myself, Lucas Pham, Mehak Jay, Faraz Piracha, Sophie Hews, and Michael Choi. Our project is a highly extensive mental and physical health centered help tool. It will be hosted on a website, and have varying sections that focus on different aspects of the user's well-being. It will include engaging activies that can reduce stress, and improve mood. It will offer tips and advice for a wide variety of issues, including depression, anxiety, sleep, and relationship issues. We'll offer a range of physical excercises as well, such as yoga and cardio. Our team is dedicated to the notion that everyone deserves access to mental health support, and we're commited to delivering a project that's both accessible, and easy to understand.</p>
