    <h3>17-Apr-2023</h3>
    <h2>Third Week of April</h2>
    <h3>Website Design and Updates</h3>
    <p>This week, my primary focus is on making the website design more consistent across each area. I believe that a cohesive and seamless experience will greatly improve user engagement and satisfaction. I'll be closely examining each page and making necessary adjustments to ensure a harmonious look and feel throughout the site.</p>
    <h3>Adding More Games</h3>
    <p>Additionally, I plan to expand the selection of games available on the website. This will not only provide more entertainment options for visitors but also help to keep them on the site for longer periods of time. I'm currently researching games that'll fit in our website.</p>
    <h3>Improving Website Navigation</h3>
    <p>Lastly, I'll be working on enhancing the website's navigation system to make it more user-friendly and intuitive. By simplifying the menu structure and providing clear, easy-to-find links, I aim to create a more enjoyable and frustration-free browsing experience for all visitors.</p>

    <h3>23-Jan-2023</h3>
    <h2>Fourth Week of January</h2>
    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
    <p>I began using Javascript, it's been a bit of a difficult transition. The minor differences didn't seem like it would cause that much of a learning curve, but honestly it's been more of a hassle than I'd like to admit. Fortunately, once you learn one coding language, it's really not that difficult to pick-up another. Another week or so of getting used to it, and I'm sure it'll be like second-nature.</p>
    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
    <p>I was absent from class a lot this week, and so I missed some time with my group members. Not much was done during the week, so it wasn't that detremintal, but as the Project Manager I'd still like to avoid missing any further class.</p>
    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
    <p>No interpersonal challenges occured this week.</p>

    <h3>9-Jan-2023</h3>
    <h2>Second Week of January</h2>
    <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
    <p>We all had some pretty mutual issues with figuring out how to use Github with the Codermerlin Server, and to be honest I think we were all just severely overthinking it. Luckily, one of our members was able to show us how to get it to work, and we all get it now. Other than that, not much was done, so we didn't run into any technical challenges.</p>
    <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
    <p>I was sick for a majority of the week, causing a severe dampen of my personal progress on this week's goals. I'm glad it happened early on instead of later where it could've halted more major progress. I've recovered and have fully caught back up on everything that was needed to be done.</p>
    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
    <p>I didn't have any trouble with any group members this week, everyone's been doing their best to help each other out. It's nice to have such an efficent and self-sufficent group, it makes me very confident in our ability to make quick significant progress.</p>

    <h3>2-Jan-2023</h3>
    <h2>First Week of January</h2>
    <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
    <p>Our group has yet to have any major technical challenges, as we have yet to begin working on the software itself. One of the main issues we had once we begun planning was the issue of the communication between members, as there's a lot of us and one of our members are in a different class period as well. A Discord Server that took five minutes to setup completely fixed our issue of communication, we now have a place to save references, plan ahead, and give everyone the ability to respond in their own time.</p>
    <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
    <p>No scheduling issues have occured yet, everyone's been super open to talking and meeting about our project. When someone hasn't been able to show, we've saved the main points of the conversation in a Discord Channel that they could read over whenever they were able. Related to scheduling, we are all a bit mutually worried about the practicality of a member being in a separate class than us. The Discord Server helps with this but there's still a lot that is developed during a class period. For now though, we just have to see what happens. If any issues arise, I'm confident in our ability to find a way around it.</p>
    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
    <p>Everyone in our group has been super willing to work and contribute to the project; there have been no issues with anyone in our group as of now. We're all extremely excited to get started, and while there have been conflicting opinions about the direction of the ISP, all has been done through mature and formal conversations that have ended in very mutual solutions.</p>
    <h3>Development Engineer</h3>
    <p>Development Engineers are those tasked with overseeing every little aspect of the project, start to finish. They forge the software, find and recieve it's issues, and fix them with resourceful solutions. They're the beating heart of ISP, nothing would get done without them.</p>
    <h3>QA Engineer</h3>
    <p>Our QA Engineers take a hammer to our delicately assembled software. They subject our ISP to rigorous testing to ensure it's functionality. Nothing is ready for public use until it's been built, tested, broken down to square one, rebuilt back up, and broken down again. Without QA Engineers, our project would be buggy and experimental, filled with oversights and aberrations.</p>
    <h3>Project Manager</h3>
    <p>Our Project Manager is in charge of keeping everyone in line. Efficency is key to success, and efficency is built upon good leadership. The Project Manager will ensure things are running smoothly, and more than sufficient progres is being made to reach our goals in time.</p>
    <h3>Product Manager</h3>
    <p>The Product Manager, idealistic but pragmatic. No other role would have a job without a vision and a plan, and our Product Manager delivers. They understand the customer's needs and issues, and use these to set the project's goals. The Product Manager gives our ISP value and meaning.</p>
