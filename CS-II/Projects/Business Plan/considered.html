	<h1>Considered Teams</h1>
	<h2>Mehak Jay</h2>
	<p>Mehak Jay was doing a project that used an AI API to engage in therapeutic conversations via a graphical interface. I was initially going to join this group, Artificial Intelligence is really cool and I thought it'd be a fun thing to learn, especially in such an enviornment. The reason I ultimately decided against this group was because of a group merger; the Artificial Intelligence element is now part of Mason Graham's Brain site, and the group that I'm now a part of</p>
	<h2>Helen Giordano</h2>
	<p>Helen Giordano was also doing an emotional assistant API using AI, though through a chatbot instead of a graphical interface. Giordano ended up merging with Mehak Jay, and that group is once again now apart of Mason Graham's Brain site.</p>
	<h2>Andrew Lin</h2>
	<p>Andrew Lin is doing a project to increse lunch time speeds by using a mobile pick-up system, this project greatly intrigued me as it's use is incredibly practical and would be the perfect project for engaging in a realistic software development team, but I decided against it for multiple factors. Andrew Lin and his team are not present in my class period; and while that could be worked around, that'd ultimately stop me from being truly occupied with the project and the other team members. Also, while the concept is very realistic, I wanted to join a team that is a bit more ambitious in it's scopes, I want something that challenges even our most experienced programmers. For these reasons, I decided that Andrew Lin's project most likely wouldn't be the best decision, though I hope to see how it goes.</p>
	<h2>Faraz Piracha</h2>
	<p>Faraz Piracha's project was an auto recipe generated based on your home's ingredient inventory. This is super cool! The idea immediately peaked my interest and Faraz is a great person to work with, but I ended up passing on it. The more I thought about it the more I realized that all this would be a simple straightforward database of recipes, and to be honest I wanted something bit more challenging. I guess Faraz believed the same as he also disbanded his group in order to join Mason Graham's Brain site.</p>
	<h2>Loren Pontiff</h2>
	<p>My project, a world hunger estimation calculator to spread awareness to the public, I really, really enjoyed this idea. My main inspiration was the Climate Clock, and that has been incredibly successful in spreading awareness for the climate crisis. However, in the end I decided that it probably wouldn't be the best idea. First of all, it's ambitious. I'm still pretty bad at algebra, and finding accurate statistics to create a non-misleading formula was going to be hard. On top of that, it didn't draw any traction from other people, and I'd really like to work with a good, talented, engaging team. For these reasons I moved on from my own idea and started looking elsewhere</p>
	<h2>Jakob McPherson</h2>
	<p>Jakob McPherson has an incredibly cool idea, an adaptive Neural Network. It sounds awesome and I'd love to see how that project goes, but it was an easy decision to decide against it. McPherson's project is very, very, ambitious, at least in it's current form. To make that worse, working on this project across classes would be a challenge at best. Excited to see what comes of it, but I cannot confidently join this project.</p>
	<h2>Jana Daouk</h2>
	<p>Jana Daouk's project is something that I've personally wished existed for awhile now, an outfit generator. Not only does this project sound really cool, but also it sounds like it'd be a lot of fun to develop. Still though, I decided against it. Daouk's team is in another class, and as I've made clear, I don't think working cross-classes is a good idea. Hoping their project goes well, though!</p>
	<h2>Melanie Lopez</h2>
	<p>Melanie Lopez's project is simple and straight forward, and solves an everyday problem. Lopez is a good friend of mine, and I'd love to work on a project with her, but unfortunately she's not in my class, which makes me weary about joining her development team. Further, while simplicity isn't necessarily a bad thing, I'd like to join a project that's more ambitious and challenging, so for these reason's I kept looking.</p>
	<h2>Sri Nagasai</h2>
	<p>Sri Nagasi's project is one that stood out to me, no other group had no idea similar to it. Building a search engine genuinely sounds like a lot of fun, but also it should be considered how ambitious it is. If they are to do what's promised and create a new fully functioning browser, I'm worried they don't know what they're getting themselves into. Added on that they're in a different class, I can't see myself joining this project.</p>
	<h1>Mason Graham</h1>
	<p>Mason Graham's is a educational and interactive site about the human brain. This development team has some incredible, talented people on it, with some great ideas on the table. This is the group I've joined, and I'm very excited to see where it goes from here. The team has a large assortment of knowledge of varying degrees, and everyone is doing something different for the project to make it the best it can be. The things I've already seen are really cool, and the entire team is super dedicated. I'm looking forward to working with everyone.</p>
