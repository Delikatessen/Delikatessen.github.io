	<h1>Considered Teams</h1>
	<h2>Mehak Jay</h2>
	<p>Mehak Jay was doing a project that used an AI API to engage in therapeutic conversations via a graphical interface. I was initially going to join this group, Artificial Intelligence is really cool and I thought it'd be a fun thing to learn, especially in such an enviornment. The reason I ultimately decided against this group was because of a group merger; the Artificial Intelligence element is now part of Mason Graham's Brain site, and the group that I'm now a part of</p>
	<h2>Helen Giordano</h2>
	<p>Helen Giordano was also doing an emotional assistant API using AI, though through a chatbot instead of a graphical interface. Giordano ended up merging with Mehak Jay, and that group is once again now apart of Mason Graham's Brain site.</p>
	<h2>Andrew Lin</h2>
	<p>Andrew Lin is doing a project to increse lunch time speeds by using a mobile pick-up system, this project greatly intrigued me as it's use is incredibly practical and would be the perfect project for engaging in a realistic software development team, but I decided against it for multiple factors. Andrew Lin and his team are not present in my class period; and while that could be worked around, that'd ultimately stop me from being truly occupied with the project and the other team members. Also, while the concept is very realistic, I wanted to join a team that is a bit more ambitious in it's scopes, I want something that challenges even our most experienced programmers. For these reasons, I decided that Andrew Lin's project most likely wouldn't be the best decision, though I hope to see how it goes.</p>
