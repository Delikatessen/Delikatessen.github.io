<h2>Should our Government regulate AI?</h2>
<p>No, the government should not. Artificial Intelligence is going to revolutionize every single industry and field on Earth, that's not an exaggeration. The government is sloppy, uneducated, and driven by fear. Whatever decisions the government would make to regulate AI, would be bad for AI, and bad for us. We just saw the court hearing for Tiktok, one of the main speakers asked if the app connected to wifi for gods sake, and tried to use that as an argument as to why it's bad? No, the government doesn't know what they're talking about or what this technology is, and I think it should be allowed to grow and develop on it's own without the intervention of someone who thinks they know better. No one knows better than the companies deveoping the software.</P>
